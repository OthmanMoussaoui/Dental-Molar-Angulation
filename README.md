# Dental Molar Angulation Project

Welcome to the Dental Molar Angulation Project! This repository contains resources and code related to dental molar angulation analysis using machine learning techniques. This README file will guide you through the contents and usage of this repository.

## Project Overview

Dental molar angulation plays a crucial role in orthodontics, impacting occlusal balance and aesthetics. This project aims to predict molar angles using machine learning models trained on augmented dental image datasets.

## Contents

The repository contains the following directories and files:

1. **annotation:** XML files containing annotations for the dental images.

2. **augmented_csv:** CSV files generated from augmented image data.

3. **augmented_images:** Augmented dental images used for training and analysis.

4. **image Original data:** Original dental images for reference and analysis.

5. **transformed_images:** Images generated after applying transformations (e.g., scaling, rotation).

6. **transformed_images_drawn:** Augmented images with annotated molar positions and angulations.

7. **TP_Dental_Moussaoui.pdf:** Detailed documentation and research paper related to the Dental Molar Angulation project. This document provides in-depth information about the project's background, methodology, and findings.

8. **notebook_Dental.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing the Python script used for data processing, model training, and analysis. You can refer to this notebook to explore the code and workflow.

## Usage

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Review the documentation in **TP_Dental_Moussaoui.pdf** to gain an understanding of the project's objectives and findings.

2. Explore the Jupyter Notebook in **notebook_Dental.ipynb** to delve into the code and analysis.

3. Examine the augmented images in the **augmented_images** and **transformed_images_drawn** directories to understand the variations in dental molar images.

4. If you wish to reproduce the data augmentation and analysis, refer to the code in the Jupyter Notebook and follow the provided instructions.
